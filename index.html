    <h1>Praise the Sun!!!</h1>
    <h2>The Nameless King is the God Gwyn's FirstBorn</h2>
    <h3>He is a God of War, who betrayed his father</h3>
    <h4>He sided with the Dragons in the War of the First Flame</h4>
    <h2>Solaire of Astora is a follower of the Nameless King</h2>
  </header>
  <p>A brave and jolly knight, who made himself undead</p>
  <p>He enjoys engaging in Jolly Cooperation</p>
  <p>He seeks his own Sun, He worships the Sun. He Praises the Sun!!!</p>
  <p>and at the same time wishes to complete the Undead Quest to Link the First Flame</p>
  <p>Yet he befriends and aids you in your quest to Link the First Flame</p>
  <p>But his tale ends in Tragedy</p>
  <p>In seeking his own Sun, He goes into Lost Izalith</p>
  <p>He encounters the Sunlight Maggot and goes insane</p>
  <p>He raves on about becoming his Sun</p>
  <p>But you know you must slay him, to stop your friend's misery</p>
  <p>And so you do, You slay the Jolly knight of Astora</p>
  <br>
  <p>But what if you chose another way</p>
  <p>What if you chose to enter another door</p>
  <p>To arrive before Solaire</p>
  <p>To destroy the Maggots before they took his mind</p>
  <p>Your friend, would fight, the greatest fight</p>
  <p>To save the world from the Abyss</p>
  <p>To find a different Sun and become it</p>
  <p>By Linking the First Flame alongside You</p>
